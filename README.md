# StudentGradePrediction
About : In recent years, the educational level of the Portuguese population has significantly improved, particularly in disciplines such as mathematics and language. The purpose of this study is to apply machine learning techniques to estimate a secondary school student's final grade. The research begins with an exploratory data analysis(EDA) to determine the influences on a student's final grade, such as age, family, social, and personal life. Multiple regression model and classification models are built to predict the studentsâ€™ performance.

Data Set : The data used in this study comes from two Portuguese secondary schools for two courses in Mathematics and Portuguese. Since the dataset was compiled from two different sources, mark reports and questionnaires, it includes the students' grades as well as socioeconomic aspects that may influence their performance. The data was integrated into two datasets related to Mathematics (with 395 records) and the Portuguese language (649 records) classes. The data can be found in data folder.
